Description of website:
This website is meant to be a fun game for users to play whenever and wherever they want. The game itself is a dogder game that users can control with their left and right arrow keys or by swiping if they are on mobile to avoid obstacles coming at them.



Design process:
I wanted this website to have a light and airy feel, so I chose a white and blue colour scheme so that it matches the theme of the game, which is flying a plane through the sky and avoiding obstacles. Leaderboard is there to encourage user's comepetitive spirit and aim for the top. I used API/RestDB to store user's data and help them to login/signup as well as update their highscore when they play the game.
