Description of website:
This website is meant to be a fun game for users to play whenever and wherever they want. The game itself is an airplane dodger game where users have to avoid obstacles coming at them. These obstacles can range from anything like birds to clouds and even UFOs, and gain a point everytime they dodge one. 

Design process:
I wanted this website to have a light and airy feel, so I chose a white and blue colour scheme so that it matches the theme of the game, which is flying a plane through the sky and avoiding obstacles. Wherever possible, I chose to use clouds to display details such as in the profile page where it displays the highscore. I wanted it to look fun and cute, while also retaining a retro game vibe

Features:
I used API/RestDB to store user's data and help them to login/signup as well as update their highscore when they play the game. This means that it can authenticate whether a user's password is correct, or if the username and email is unique/not unique.

Leaderboard was implemented in order to encourage users' competitive spirit so that they can aim for the top. 

I made sure to allow ease of use throughout all platforms so users can access it from any device; for example, features like the hamburger menu and the ability to adapt to any browser size to ensure a pleasant experience. 

The game itself is compatible even on mobile as it enables touch and swiping to allow player to control the plane. 

To implement in future:
Display user rank in the profile page. 
Different sized obstacles. 
Update user data form.
