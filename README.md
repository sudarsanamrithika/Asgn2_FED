Description of website:
This website is meant to be a fun game for users to play whenever and wherever they want. The game itself is a dogder game that users can control with their left and right arrow keys or by swiping if they are on mobile to avoid obstacles coming at them.



Design process:
I wanted this website to have a light and airy feel, so I chose a white and blue colour scheme so that it matches the theme of the game, which is flying a plane through the sky and avoiding obstacles. Wherever possible, I chose to use clouds to display details such as in the profile page where it displays the highscore. I wanted it to look fun and cute, while also retaining the retro game vibe with a modern twist that I liked about the dinosaur game. 

Features:
I used API/RestDB to store user's data and help them to login/signup as well as update their highscore when they play the game. This means that it can authenticate whether a user's password is correct, or if the username and email is unique/not unique.

Leaderboard was implemented in order to encourage users' competitive spirit so that they can aim for the top. 

I made sure to allow ease of use throughout all platforms so users can access it from any device; for example, features like the hamburger menu and the ability to adapt to any browser size to ensure a pleasant experience. 

The game itself is compatible even on mobile as it enables touch and swiping to allow player to control the plane. 

To implement in future:
Display user rank in the profile page. 
Different sized obstacles. 
Update user data form.
